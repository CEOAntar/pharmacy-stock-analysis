# 🧪 Pharmacy Stock Analysis Project

This project is a real-world data analysis I built based on my experience working as a stock controller at a pharmacy chain. It reflects my ability to extract insights from operational data and make smarter inventory decisions using Python and data visualization tools.

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

In this analysis, I worked with 30 days' worth of pharmacy stock and sales data. The goal was to identify fast-moving and stagnant products across different branches, and help optimize stock distribution based on actual demand.

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Understand product performance across multiple branches
- Identify unsold products and potential overstock
- Highlight best-selling categories
- Calculate current stock value
- Visualize key trends for decision-making

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

This isn’t a tutorial-based project — it’s based on real, messy data I pulled from our pharmacy system.  
I cleaned it, organized it, and turned it into something actionable. This helped me sharpen my analytical thinking and practice using Python in a practical setting. It also represents my commitment to solving real-world problems through data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – for all the data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy** – for cleaning and transforming data
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – to visualize trends and comparisons
- **Jupyter Notebook** – to document and present the process
- **Excel** – for initial manual data cleanup
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and collaboration

---

## 📊 Sample Insights (from the analysis)

- Over 10 products had zero sales in the past 30 days — potential overstock.
- One branch accounts for 40%+ of total sales — a key focus for resupply.
- Some categories like [Pain Relief] consistently outperform others.
- Total stock value calculated by product and branch.

📥 What's Next?

I plan to improve this project by:

    Adding more KPIs like turnover ratio and average daily sales

    Automating low-stock alerts

    Trying out basic SQL queries to filter and segment data

👋 About Me
 I'm Mohamed Antar — a data analyst and inventory manager with a background in computer science. This project reflects my day-to-day work managing pharmacy stock while using data-driven insights to improve operations.

I built this analysis to track stock levels, identify slow-moving items, and support better purchasing decisions. Using Python, pandas, and matplotlib, I was able to turn raw inventory data into actionable insights and clean visualizations.

This isn't just a technical showcase — it's a real-world project grounded in my actual job, and it helped me sharpen my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and business problem solving.

I’m learning fast, building useful tools, and looking to grow as a data professional. Thanks for stopping by!
